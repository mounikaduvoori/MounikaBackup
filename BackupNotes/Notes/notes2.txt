Tagging:
--------
>>A tag is something similar to a pointer.
ex:
---
u hav got a commmit 
3be565cb7

this was the last commit inside a release or it was the first release candiadate
 >>so u want to knw later which version it was

>>if we want to see all similar tags foa a name.we type
  'git tag -l release-candidate*'
(to see all release candidate tags)

>>> we can list all tags using 
  'git tag -l'


>>>we have to create a object to add more notes to a tag
these tags save more than just a commit to wish they point

>>>>They save
    -who tagged the commit(tagger)
    -when was the commit tagged?(date)
    -a message
 

>>lets create a tag for the first commit
   we call the tag "init"

<<<we create such "annotated" tags using the  -a
switch behind git tag

>>now vim opened

>>>use the -m switch to set a msg

>>we can use git show 
  'git show $TAG/$ID'(to show a specific commit)

>>so the output is 
the commit id,
THe author,
the date,
the msg, and diff to the previous commit
(everything is green bcz this was the 1st commit)


>>GIT knows now:
init    -->the first commit
release-candidate(important) -->the latest commit

we can use them like IDs now:
'git diff init Important'
