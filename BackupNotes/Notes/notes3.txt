Branches:
--------
Branching, in revision control and software configuration management, is the duplication 
of an object under revision control (such as a source code file or a directory tree) so 
that modifications can happen in parallel along both branches.

Branches are also known as trees, streams or codelines. The originating branch is 
sometimes called the parent branch, the upstream branch (or simply upstream, especially 
if the branches are maintained by different organizations or individuals), or the backing 
stream. Child branches are branches that have a parent; a branch without a parent 
is referred to as the trunk or the mainline..

>>we always start at the master branch,so the version is master

>>on which u r rightnow
      'git branch'


>>now.let's create a branch for our function v r gng to implement

>>create a branch 
     git branch <name>
>>we can change to the other branch using 
  git checkout <name>
>>Note:
------
First we need to check that the working directory has nothing in it,we have
  not already comitted
>>Branches are like tags,commits "objects".
you can compare them using

git diff

>>the code is shown in diff.


>><<<Now we switch back to first  version



As you can see the code is away
its now stored inside the "A" branch

this is about switching the branches

>>>deleting the branches using

   'git branch -d <branchname>
>>>>Force delete 
    'git branch -D <branchname>
