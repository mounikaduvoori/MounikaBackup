DEvops:
------
I think DevOps can be explained simply as operations working together with engineers to get
 things done faster in an automated and repeatable way.

DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the 
entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support.

DevOps is also characterized by operations staff making use many of the same techniques as 
developers for their systems work.
